This plugin is a port of the popular bukkit plugin called ["WorldGuard"](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard). It was originally developed by [Muqsit](https://github.com/Muqsit), but more flags and extended capabilities were added by me.

# Features
- User friendly interface for users that prefer a menu rather than typing lenghty commands.   
- Easily define regions in your world.
- Set custom flags on defined regions that allow/restrict certain actions and events.
- Delete/Modify already defined regions.
- Give special permissions to your players to bypass certain flags. (Usefull for mods, admins, vips, etc.)

# Utility
- Defined regions can be used to protect specific areas of your world from griefing, pvp, damaging mobs, building, and some other events.  
For the full list of flags check the tutorial.

# Tutorial

# Customizable Permissions
Some flags come with their own permission in order to customize regions even more and only allow certain groups of players do certain actions in a region.
